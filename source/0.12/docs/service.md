title: Service
---
The Service represents a microservice in the Moleculer. You can define actions and subscribe to events. To create a service you need to define a schema. The service schema is similar to [a component of VueJS](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html#What-are-Components).

## Schema
The schema has some main parts: `name`, `version`, `settings`, `actions`, `methods`, `events`, `created`, `started`, `stopped`.

### Simple service schema to define two actions
```js
{
    name: "math",
    actions: {
        add(ctx) {
            return Number(ctx.params.a) + Number(ctx.params.b);
        },

        sub(ctx) {
            return Number(ctx.params.a) - Number(ctx.params.b);
        }
    }
}
```

## Base properties
The Service has some base properties in the schema.
```js
{
    name: "posts",
    version: 1
}
```
The `name` is a mandatory property so it must be defined. It's the first part of action name when you call it with `broker.call`.

> You can disable service name prefixing with the `$noServiceNamePrefix: true` setting in Service settings.

The `version` is an optional property. If you are running multiple version of the same service this needs to be set. It will be a prefix in the actionName. It can be a `Number` or a `String`.
```js
{
    name: "posts",
    version: 2,
    actions: {
        find() {...}
    }
}
```
You can call this `find` action on version `2` service:
```js
broker.call("v2.posts.find");
```
{% note info REST call %}
If you are using our [Moleculer Web](moleculer-web.html) module, you can request it as `GET /v2/posts/find`.
{% endnote %}

> You can disable version prefixing with the `$noVersionPrefix: true` setting in Service settings.

## Settings
The `settings` property is a store, where you can store every settings/options to your service. You can access it in the service via `this.settings`.

```js
{
    name: "mailer",
    settings: {
        transport: "mailgun"
    },

    action: {
        send(ctx) {
            if (this.settings.transport == "mailgun") {
                ...
            }
        }
    }
}
```
> The settings is also obtainable on remote nodes. It is transferred during service discovering.

## Internal settings
There are some internal settings which are used by core modules. These settings name starts with `$` sign.

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `$noVersionPrefix` | `Boolean` | `false` | Disable version prefixing in action names. |
| `$noServiceNamePrefix` | `Boolean` | `false` | Disable service name prefixing in action names. |

## Mixins
Mixins are a flexible way to distribute reusable functionalities for Moleculer services. The Service constructor merges these mixins with the Service schema. It is to reuse another Service in your service or you can extend another Service. When a service uses mixins, all properties in the mixin will be "mixed" into the serviceâ€™s own properties.

**Example how to extend `moleculer-web` service**

```js
const ApiGwService = require("moleculer-web");

module.exports = {
    name: "api",
    mixins: [ApiGwService]
    settings: {
        // Change port setting
        port: 8080
    },
    actions: {
        myAction() {
            // Add a new action to apiGwService service
        }
    }
}
```
The above example creates an `api` service which inherits all from `ApiGwService` but overwrite the port setting and add a new `myAction` action.

### Merge algorithm
The merge algorithm depends on the property type.

| Property | Algorithm |
|----------|-----------|
| `name`, `version` | Merge & overwrite. |
| `settings` | Extend with [defaultsDeep](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.4#defaultsDeep). |
| `actions` | Extend with defaultsDeep. _You can disable an action from mixin if you set to `false` in your service._ |
| `methods` | Merge & overwrite. |
| `events` | Concatenate. |
| `created`, `started`, `stopped` | Concatenate. |
| `mixins` | Concatenate. |
| any other | Merge & overwrite. |

{% note %}
__Merge & overwrite__: if serviceA has `a: 5`, `b: 8` and serviceB has `c: 10`, `b: 15`, the mixed service will have `a: 5`, `b: 15` and `c: 10`.
__Concatenate__: if serviceA & serviceB subscribe to `users.created` event, both event handler will be called when the `users.created` event emitted.
{% endnote %}

## Actions
The actions are the callable/public methods of the service. It becomes callable with `broker.call`.
The action could be a function (shorthand for handler) or an object with some properties above all with the `handler`.
The actions should be placed under the `actions` key.

```js
{
    name: "math",
    actions: {
        // Shorthand definition, only the handler function
        add(ctx) {
            return Number(ctx.params.a) + Number(ctx.params.b);
        },

        // Normal definition with other properties. In this case
        // the `handler` function is required!
        mult: {
            cache: false,
            params: {
                a: "number",
                b: "number"
            },
            handler(ctx) {
                // The action params becomes accessible as `ctx.action.*`
                if (!ctx.action.cache)
                    return Number(ctx.params.a) * Number(ctx.params.b);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
You can call the above actions as
```js
broker.call("math.add", { a: 5, b: 7 }).then(res => console.log(res));
broker.call("math.mult", { a: 10, b: 31 }).then(res => console.log(res));
```

Inside the action you can call other actions in other services with `ctx.call` method. It is an alias to `broker.call`, just set itself as parent context (due to metrics).
```js
{
    name: "posts",
    actions: {
        get(ctx) => {
            // Find a post by ID
            let post = posts[ctx.params.id];

            // Populate the post.author field through "users" service
            // Call the "users.get" action with author ID
            return ctx.call("users.get", { id: post.author }).then(user => {
                if (user) {
                    // Replace the author ID with the received user object
                    post.author = user;
                }

                return post;
            })
        }
    }
}
```
> In handlers the `this` is pointed to the Service instance.


## Events
You can subscribe to events under the `events` key.

```js
{
    name: "report",
    actions: {
        ...
    },

    events: {
        // Subscribe to "user.created" event
        "user.created"(payload) {
            this.logger.info("User created:", payload);
            // Do something
        },

        // Subscribe to all "user.*" event
        "user.*"(payload, sender, eventName) {
            // Do something with payload. The `eventName` contains
            // the original event name. E.g. `user.modified`.
            // The `sender` is the nodeID of sender.
        }

        // Subscribe to a local event
        "$node.connected"({ node }) {
            this.logger.info(`Node '${node.id}' is connected!`);
        }
    }

}
```
> In handlers the `this` is pointed to the Service instance.

The broker groups the event listeners by group name. The group name is the name of the service where your event handler is declared. You can change it in the event definition.

```js
module.export = {
    name: "payment",
    events: {
        "order.created": {
            // Register handler to "other" group instead of "payment" group.
            group: "other",
            handler(payload) {
                // ...
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Methods
You can also create private functions in the Service. They are called as `methods`. These functions are private, can't be called with `broker.call`. But you can call it inside service (from action handlers, event handlers or lifecycle event handlers).

**Usage**
```js
{
    name: "mailer",
    actions: {
        send(ctx) {
            // Call the `sendMail` method
            return this.sendMail(ctx.params.recipients, ctx.params.subject, ctx.params.body);
        }
    },

    methods: {
        // Send an email to recipients
        sendMail(recipients, subject, body) {
            return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
                ...
            });
        }
    }
}
```
> The name of the method can't be `name`, `version`, `settings`, `schema`, `broker`, `actions`, `logger`, because these words are reserved in the schema.

> In methods the `this` is pointed to the Service instance.

## Lifecycle events
There are some lifecycle service events, that will be triggered by broker.

```js
{
    name: "www",
    actions: {...},
    events: {...},
    methods: {...},

    created() {
        // Fired when the service instance created. (broker.loadService or broker.createService)
    },

    started() {
        // Fired when `broker.start()` called.
    }

    stopped() {
        // Fired when `broker.stop()` called.
    }
}
```
## Dependencies

The `Service` schema has a new `dependencies` property. The serice can wait for other dependening ones when it starts. This way you don't need to call `waitForServices` in `started` any longer.

```js
module.exports = {
  name: "posts",
  settings: {
      $dependencyTimeout: 30000 // Default: 0 - no timeout
  },
  dependencies: [
      "likes", // shorthand w/o version
      { name: "users", version: 2 }, // with numeric version
      { name: "comments", version: "staging" } // with string version
  ],
  started() {
      this.logger.info("Service started after the dependent services available.");
  }
  ....
}
```
The `started` service handler is called once the `likes`, `users` and `comments` services are registered (on the local or remote nodes).

## Metadata

The `Service` schema has a new `metadata` property. The Moleculer modules doesn't use it, so you can use it whatever you want.

```js
broker.createService({
    name: "posts",
    settings: {},
    metadata: {
        scalable: true,
        priority: 5
    },

    actions: { ... }
});
```

> The `metadata` is transferred between nodes, you can access it via `$node.services`. Or inside service with `this.metadata` like settings.

## Properties of `this`
In service functions, `this` is always pointed to the Service instance. It has some properties & methods which you can use in your service functions.

| Name | Type |  Description |
| ------- | ----- | ------- |
| `this.name` | `String` | Name of service (from schema) |
| `this.version` | `Number` or `String` | Version of service (from schema) |
| `this.settings` | `Object` | Settings of service (from schema) |
| `this.schema` | `Object` | Schema definition of service |
| `this.broker` | `ServiceBroker` | Instance of broker |
| `this.Promise` | `Promise` | Class of Promise (Bluebird) |
| `this.logger` | `Logger` | Logger instance |
| `this.actions` | `Object` | Actions of service. *Service can call own actions directly but it is not recommended. Use the `ctx.call` instead!* |
| `this.waitForServices` | `Function` | Link to ['broker.waitForServices' method](broker.html#Wait-for-services) |

## Create a service
There are several ways to create/load a service.

### broker.createService()
Call the `broker.createService` method with the schema of service as the first argument. It's simple & fast. Use it when you are developing or prototyping.

```js
broker.createService({
    name: "math",
    actions: {
        add(ctx) {
            return Number(ctx.params.a) + Number(ctx.params.b);
        }
    }
});
```

### Load service from file
The recommended way (in production) is to place your service code to a single file and load this file with the broker.

{% codeblock lang:js math.service.js %}
// Export the schema of service
module.exports = {
    name: "math",
    actions: {
        add(ctx) {
            return Number(ctx.params.a) + Number(ctx.params.b);
        },
        sub(ctx) {
            return Number(ctx.params.a) - Number(ctx.params.b);
        }
    }
}
{% endcodeblock %}

Load it with broker:
{% codeblock lang:js index.js %}
// Create broker
let broker = new ServiceBroker();

// Load service
broker.loadService("./math.service");

// Start broker
broker.start();
{% endcodeblock %}

In the service file you can also be create the Service instance. In this case you need to export a function that returns the instance of [Service](#service).
```js
// Export a function, the `loadService` will call it with the ServiceBroker instance.
module.exports = function(broker) {
    return new Service(broker, {
        name: "math",
        actions: {
            add(ctx) {
                return Number(ctx.params.a) + Number(ctx.params.b);
            },
            sub(ctx) {
                return Number(ctx.params.a) - Number(ctx.params.b);
            }
        }
    });
}
```

Or create a function which returns with the schema of service
```js
// Export a function, the `loadService` will call with the ServiceBroker instance.
module.exports = function() {
    let users = [....];

    return {
        name: "math",
        actions: {
            create(ctx) {
                users.push(ctx.params);
            }
        }
    };
}
```

### Load multiple services from a folder
If you have many services (and you will have) we suggest to put them to a `services` folder and load all of them with the `broker.loadServices` method.

**Syntax**
```js
broker.loadServices(folder = "./services", fileMask = "**/*.service.js");
```

**Example**
```js
// Load every *.service.js file from the "./services" folder
broker.loadServices();

// Load every *.service.js file from the current folder
broker.loadServices("./");

// Load every user*.service.js file from the "./svc" folder
broker.loadServices("./svc", "user*.service.js");
```

### Load with Moleculer Runner (recommended)
We recommend to use the new [Moleculer Runner](runner.html) to start a ServiceBroker and load services. [Read more about Moleculer Runner](runner.html).

## Hot reloading services
When you are developing your microservices project would be useful a hot reload function which reloads your services when you modify it. Moleculer has a built-in hot-reloading function. You can enable it in broker options or in [Moleculer Runner](runner.html).
[Demo video how it works.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9FsAvje4F4)

**Usage**

```js
let broker = new ServiceBroker({
    logger: console,
    hotReload: true
});

broker.loadService("./services/test.service.js");
```

**Usage with Moleculer Runner**

Turn it on with `--hot` or `-H` flags.

```bash
$ moleculer-runner --hot ./services/test.service.js
```

{% note info Please note %}
Hot reloading function is working only with Moleculer Runner or if you load your services with `broker.loadService` or `broker.loadServices`.
{% endnote %}

## Local variables
If you would like to use local properties/variables in your service, declare them in the `created` event handler.

**Example for local variables**
```js
const http = require("http");

module.exports = {
    name: "www",

    settings: {
        port: 3000
    },

    created() {
        // Create HTTP server
        this.server = http.createServer(this.httpHandler);
    },

    started() {
        // Listening...
        this.server.listen(this.settings.port);
    },

    stopped() {
        // Stop server
        this.server.close();
    },

    methods() {
        // HTTP handler
        httpHandler(req, res) {
            res.end("Hello Moleculer!");
        }
    }
}
```
{% note warn Naming restriction %}
It is important to be aware that you can't use such variable name which is reserved for service or coincides with your method names! E.g. `this.name`, `this.version`, `this.settings`, `this.schema`...etc.  
{% endnote %}

## ES6 classes

If you like better ES6 classes than Moleculer service schema, you can write your services in ES6 classes.

There are two ways to do it:

1. **Native ES6 classes with schema parsing**

    Define `actions` and `events` handlers as class methods. Call the `parseServiceSchema` method in constructor with schema definition where the handlers pointed to these class methods.
    ```js
    const Service = require("moleculer").Service;

    class GreeterService extends Service {

        constructor(broker) {
            super(broker);

            this.parseServiceSchema({
                name: "greeter",
                version: "v2",
                meta: {
                    scalable: true
                },
                dependencies: [
                    "auth",
                    "users"
                ],

                settings: {
                    upperCase: true
                },
                actions: {
                    hello: this.hello,
                    welcome: {
                        cache: {
                            keys: ["name"]
                        },
                        params: {
                            name: "string"
                        },
                        handler: this.welcome
                    }
                },
                events: {
                    "user.created": this.userCreated
                },
                created: this.serviceCreated,
                started: this.serviceStarted,
                stopped: this.serviceStopped,
            });
        }

        // Action handler
        hello() {
            return "Hello Moleculer";
        }

        // Action handler
        welcome(ctx) {
            return this.sayWelcome(ctx.params.name);
        }

        // Private method
        sayWelcome(name) {
            this.logger.info("Say hello to", name);
            return `Welcome, ${this.settings.upperCase ? name.toUpperCase() : name}`;
        }

        // Event handler
        userCreated(user) {
            this.broker.call("mail.send", { user });
        }

        serviceCreated() {
            this.logger.info("ES6 Service created.");
        }

        serviceStarted() {
            this.logger.info("ES6 Service started.");
        }

        serviceStopped() {
            this.logger.info("ES6 Service stopped.");
        }
    }

    module.exports = GreeterService;
    ```

2. **Use decorators**

    Thanks for [@ColonelBundy](https://github.com/ColonelBundy), you can use ES7/TS decorators as well: [moleculer-decorators](https://github.com/ColonelBundy/moleculer-decorators)

    >Please note, you need to use Typescript or Babel to compile decorators.

    **Example service**
    ```js
    const moleculer = require('moleculer');
    const { Service, Action, Event, Method } = require('moleculer-decorators');
    const web = require('moleculer-web');
    const broker = new moleculer.ServiceBroker({
        logger: console,
        logLevel: "debug",
    });

    @Service({
        mixins: [web],
        settings: {
            port: 3000,
            routes: [
            ...
            ]
        }
    })
    class ServiceName {
        @Action()
        Login(ctx) {
            ...
        }

        // With options
        @Action({
            cache: false,
            params: {
                a: "number",
                b: "number"
            }
        })
        Login2(ctx) {
            ...
        }

        @Event
        'event.name'(payload, sender, eventName) {
            ...
        }

        @Method
        authorize(ctx, route, req, res) {
            ...
        }

        hello() { // Private
            ...
        }

        started() { // Reserved for moleculer, fired when started
            ...
        }

        created() { // Reserved for moleculer, fired when created
            ...
        }

        stopped() { // Reserved for moleculer, fired when stopped
            ...
        }
    }

    broker.createService(ServiceName);
    broker.start();
    ```
