# Translations
Do you speak multiple languages? We need your help!
To get started translating, visit https://moleculer.crowdin.com/moleculer-documentation and log in with your GitHub account.
Select your language and you can start translating.

**Here are some guidelines to keep in mind as a translator:**

- Don't open pull requests to translate Moleculer documentation; instead, do all translations on Crowdin.
- Do not translate JavaScript keywords like String, Event, Array, Class, etc.
- Do not translate Moleculer classes, method names, event names, etc.
- If you find an error in the source English docs, open a pull request on the [moleculerjs/site](https://github.com/moleculerjs/site) repository.
- If you've been working as a translator and want to have more influence over the approved translations in your language, let us know and we'll make you a proofreader.

Moleculer's localization effort uses Crowdin, an awesome platform for collaborative translation. Changes on Crowdin are automatically turned into pull requests on this GitHub repository.
